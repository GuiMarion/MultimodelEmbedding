# Automatic transcription using embedding latent space

This work adresses the problem of automatic transcription of musical audio pieces to midi sheets. We propose a method
based on recent research by Dorfer et al.[4] that learns joint embedding spaces for short excerpts of musical audio and
their respective counterparts in midi scores, using multimodal convolutional neural networks. The dataset is based on Pianomidi.de, a midi sheet collection of classical music played on piano and splitted by Poliner and Ellis [2006] comprising 314
midi scores from 25 composers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
