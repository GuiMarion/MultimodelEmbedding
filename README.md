# MultimodelEmbedding
Multimodal embedding music for automatic piece recognition spaces. Machine Learning project for ATIAM master's degree at IRCAM.


You need to implement 4 functions:

  - gemetric series (U_n = somme des u_i)
  - the gamma function (G(n)=(n-1)!)
  - function de fibonacci (F_n+2 = F_n+1 + F_n)
  - arithmetic function (u0 = 3 and r = 12)
  
  
Each of you implements one separetly and merge with all the others.
